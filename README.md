OpenGL Homework

This is a set of projects based on OpenGL:
- A OBJ file displayer with multiple features
  - manipulate the object (zoom, spin, stretch and etc.)
  - rending with different methods
  - different shading
- A maze game that can have different maps in every round with different landscape.
